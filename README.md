## 🛡️ About Me
I am a BCA student at Manipal University with a deep fascination for how systems work—and how they can be protected. While I have a strong background in **Game Development**, I am currently dedicating my focus to **Cybersecurity across all domains**, from securing web applications to hardening network infrastructures.

- 🎓 **Education:** BCA — Manipal University
- 🔒 **Core Focus:** Cybersecurity (Elective & Self-Study)
- 🏗️ **Foundation:** Extensive experience in Game Development & Logic Design
- 🌱 **Learning:** Penetration Testing, SOC Fundamentals, and Python for Security
- 🔭 **Goal:** To become a versatile Security Researcher capable of securing any environment

## 🔐 Cybersecurity Focus Areas
I am actively learning and practicing security principles applicable to the entire tech ecosystem:

* **Network Security:** Mastering $TCP/IP$, firewalls, and traffic analysis via Wireshark.
* **Web & App Security:** Studying OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities and secure coding practices.
* **Linux & Systems:** Hardening environments and understanding OS-level security.
* **Offensive Security:** Practicing ethical hacking through CTFs and hands-on labs.

## 🕹️ Technical Foundation: Game Development
My journey in tech began with building complex interactive systems. This experience gives me a unique advantage in security: I don't just know how to use tools; I understand the underlying code and logic.

* **Logic & Scripting:** Deep understanding of C# and complex algorithm design.
* **System Optimization:** Experience managing memory, resources, and real-time data.
* **Problem Solving:** A developer's mindset helps me think like an attacker to build better defenses.
